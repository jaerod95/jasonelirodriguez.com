I guess this is working so I can write something. I'm just typing away inside of vscode, so not sure what the spell checker support is. I'm sure it's good enough, I don't really expect anyone to read this. Even if people are reading this blog sometime in the future, I doubt they take the time to go back and read this post. Who knows maybe I'll eat my words. That'd be pretty cool.

I was inspired to make my own personal website/blog/playground after seeing [Pete's website](https://www.petemillspaugh.com/) today. I've been sitting on the domain **jasonelirodriguez.com** for years now, but never took the time to setup a decent website. I guess I was always too busy, or too lazy. I'm not sure what changed today, but I'm glad I finally did it.

I setup this blog using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), styled everthing using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), and am using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files to write this post. It was dead simple to setup, and I'm pretty happy with the results. I'm not sure how I feel about writing in _markdown_, but I guess it's not too bad. I'm sure I'll get used to it.

I'm not sure what I'll write about, but I'm sure I'll figure it out. I'm sure I'll write about code, design, and maybe some personal stuff. Honestly this is more for me, and less about you. One of my goals this year was to be more intersting, so I guess this is a place where I can document my progress, or at least publicly shame myself for my lack of intersting things. They say negative reinforcement is a good motivator, so I guess we'll see.

I'm not sure what else to write, so I guess I'll just end it here. I'm sure I'll write more in the future, so I guess I'll see you then.
