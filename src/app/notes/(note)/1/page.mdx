{metadata.other.dateCreated}

[Promptings of the Spirit](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/25stevenson?lang=eng)

1. Stand in holy places
   Reverence standing in holy places: (Moses)

What makes a temple holy?
What makes it the house of the lord?
Dedication and consecration

1. Stand in holy places.
   1. “Our temples and homes are the most sacred of these dedicated spaces”
2. Stand with holy people.
   1. Ask for examples of holy people
   2. Share story with Cole
3. Testify of holy truths.
   1. “As you seek and take opportunities to share your testimony with others, you will create moments to recognize the Spirit for yourself.
4. Listen to the Holy Spirit.
   1. President Boyd K. Packer stated: “The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all.” I have observed that sometimes His voice is so subtle, or I am so preoccupied, that a loved one captures it for me. Many have been the times when promptings of the Holy Ghost have come to me through my wife, Lesa. Righteous parents or leaders may also receive inspired guidance for you.

The temple and the home

Other holy places include meetinghouses, seminary buildings and institutes, and Church history sites and visitors' centers

Call it out: satan is the father of all evil, and we need to call him out
Be diligent, read your scriptures
